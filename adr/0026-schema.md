# 25. Zarf Schema for v1

Date: 2024-06-07

## Status

Proposed

## Terms
v0 = any version of Zarf prior to v1

## Context

Zarf currently does not have explicit schema versions. Any schema changes are embedded into Zarf and can change with new versions. There are several examples of deprecated keys throughout Zarf's lifespan such as:

- `setVariable` deprecated in favor of `setVariables`
- `scripts` deprecated in favor of `actions`
- `required` soon to be deprecated in favor of `optional`.
- `group` deprecated in favor of `flavor`, however these work functionally different and cannot be automatically migrated
- `cosignKeyPath` deprecated in favor of specifying the key path at create time

Zarf has not disabled any deprecated keys thus far. On create the user is always warned when using a deprecated field, however the field still exists in the schema and functions properly. Some of the deprecated keys can be migrated automatically as the old item is a subset or directly related to it's replacement. For example, setVariable is automatically migrated to a single item list of setVariables. This migration occurs on the zarf.yaml fed into the package during package create, however the original field is not deleted from the packaged zarf.yaml because the Zarf binary used in the airgap or delivery environment is not assumed to have the new schema fields that the deprecated key was migrated to.

The release of v1 will provide an opportunity to delete deprecated features that Zarf has warned will be dropped in v1.

Creating a v1 schema will allow Zarf to establish a contract with it's user base that features will be supported long term. When a feature is deprecated in the v1 schema, it will remain backwards compatible.

## Decision

Zarf will begin having proper schema versions. A top level key, `apiVersion`, will be introduced to allow users to specify the schema. At the release of v1 the only valid user input for `apiVersion` will be v1. Zarf will not allow users to build using the v0 schema. `zarf package create` will fail if the user has deprecated keys or if `apiVersion` is missing and the user will be instructed to run the new `zarf dev update-schema` command. `zarf dev update-schema` will automatically migrate deprecated fields in the users `zarf.yaml` where possible. It will also add the apiVersion key and set it to v1.

The existing go types which comprise the Zarf schema will be moved to types/alpha and will never change. An updated copy of these types without the deprecated fields will be created in a package types/v1 and any future schema changes will affect these objects. Internally, Zarf will introduce translation functions which will take the alpha schema and return the v1 schema. From that point on, all function signatures that have a struct that is included in the Zarf schema will change from `types.structName` to `v1.structName`.

All deprecated features will cause an error on create. Deprecated features with a direct migration path will still be deployed if the package was created v1, as migrations will add the non deprecated fields. If a feature does not have a direct automatic migration path (cosignKeyPath & groups) the package will fail on deploy. This will happen until the alpha schema is entirely removed from Zarf, which will happen one year after v1 is released.

At create time Zarf will package both a `zarf.yaml` and a `zarfv1.yaml`. If a `zarfv1.yaml` exists Zarf will use that. If a `zarfv1.yaml` does not exist, then Zarf will know that the package was created prior to v1 and use the regular `zarf.yaml`. If the package is deployed with v0 it will read the `zarf.yaml` as normal even if the package has a `zarfv1.yaml`. This will make it simpler to drop deprecated items with migration paths from the v1 schema while remaining backwards compatible as those deprecated items will exist in the `zarf.yaml`

If a key is experimental schema it will be marked as such in the schema. A key is assumed to be stable if it's not experimental or deprecated.

There are also several other keys we plan to deprecate with automated migrations to new fields
- `.metadata.aggregateChecksum` -> `.build.aggregateChecksum`
- Metadata fields `image`, `documentation`, `url`, `authors`, `vendors` -> will become a map of `labels`
- `noWait` -> `wait` which will default to true. This change will happen on both manifests and charts
- `yolo` -> `airgap` which will default to false
- charts will change to be more explicit in the case of chartRepos and gitRepos. Also adding the localRepo field.
```yaml
- name: podinfo-git-new
  chartRepo:
    url: https://stefanprodan.github.io/podinfo
    name: podinfo # replaces repoName since it's only applicable in this situation
    localRepo: podinfo-local # this is the local repo helm uses for authentication, currently this key does not exist

- name: podinfo-repo-new
  gitRepo:
    url: https://stefanprodan.github.io/podinfo
    path: charts/podinfo

- name: podinfo-oci-new
  ociUrl: oci://ghcr.io/stefanprodan/charts/podinfo

- name: podinfo-local-same
  localPath: chart
```
- actions will change... TODO @schristoff

### BDD scenarios
The following are (behavior driven development)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development] scenarios provide context of what Zarf will do in specific situations given the above decisions.

#### v1 create with deprecated keys
- *Given* Zarf version is v1
- *and* the `zarf.yaml` has no apiVersion or deprecated keys
- *when* the user runs `zarf package create`
- *then* they will receive an error and be told to run `zarf dev update-schema` or how to migrate off cosign key paths or how to use flavors over groups depending on the error

#### v0 create -> v1 deploy
- *Given*: A package is created with Zarf v0
- *and* that package has deprecated keys that can be automatically migrated (required, scripts, & set variables)
- *when* the package is deployed with Zarf v1
- *then* the keys will be automatically migrated & the package will be deployed without error.

#### v0 create with removed feature -> v1 deploy
- *Given*: A package is created with Zarf v0
- *and* that package has deprecated keys that cannot be automatically migrated (groups, cosignKeyPath)
- *when* the package is deployed with Zarf v1
- *then* then deploy of that package will fail and the user will be instructed to update their package

#### v1 create -> v0 deploy
- *Given*: A package is created with Zarf v1
- *and* that package uses keys that don't exist in v0
- *when* the package is deployed with Zarf v0
- *then* Zarf v0 will deploy the package without issues. If there are fields unrecognized by the v0 schema, then the user will be warned they are deploying a package that has features that do not exist in the current version of Zarf.

## Consequences
- As long as the only deprecated features in a package have migration path, and the package was built after the feature was deprecated so migrations were run, Zarf will be successful both creating a package with v1 and deploying with prev1, and creating a package with prev1 and deploying with v1.
- Users of deprecated group or cosignKeyPath might be frustrated if their packages, created prev1, error out on Zarf v1, however this is likely preferable to unexpected behavior occurring in the cluster.
- Users may be frustrated that they have to run `zarf dev update-schema` to edit their `zarf.yaml` to remove the deprecated fields and add `apiVersion`.
- We will have to have two different schema types which will be mostly be duplicate code. However the original type should never change, which mitigates much of the issue.
- By having a zarf.yaml and a zarfv1.yaml it will be easy to read and write from objects to yamls directly without having to include deprecated v0 fields in the v1 schema. However, this will also mean any new keys in v1 won't exist in the `zarf.yaml` so a v0 deploy of a v1 package will not be able to warn users of unrecognized keys, we will have to use some other method.
